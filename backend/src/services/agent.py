    Transform stream: Voice Events → Voice Events (with Agent Responses)

    This function takes a stream of upstream voice agent events and processes them.
    When an stt_output event arrives, it passes the transcript to the LangChain agent.
    The agent streams back its response tokens as agent_chunk events.
    Tool calls and results are also emitted as separate events.
    All other upstream events are passed through unchanged.

    The passthrough pattern ensures downstream stages (like TTS) can observe all
    events in the pipeline, not just the ones this stage produces. This enables
    features like displaying partial transcripts while the agent is thinking.

    Args:
        event_stream: An async iterator of upstream voice agent events

    Yields:
        All upstream events plus agent_chunk, tool_call, and tool_result events
